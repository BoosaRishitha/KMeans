# KMeans

# Project Title :
Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of American mall market called as phonix mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop. On the basis of this prediction of annual income versus spending scores.

# Disclaimer :
In this particular dataset we assume that annual income as a centroid and spending score from the 1 to 100 called as datanodes of the clusters.

# Problem Statement :
The American finance market as per the GDP of 2011 'phonix_trillums' mall as in the 1st range out of 5. The owner wants to be exact which particular shop on product search in different kind of clusters in entire mall.
As a Data Science Engineer predict the futuristic finanal market GDP rate based on no. of clusters.
The client wants atleast top 5 clusters[shops].

# Conclusion :
According to the model basics prediction using machine learning algorithm KMeans clustering we found that cluster1 which consists red color is the highest cluster which attach more than 50 datanodes.

# References :
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values. The yellow spots represents centroids are max to max only 3.
